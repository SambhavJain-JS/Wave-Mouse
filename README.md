# Wave-Mouse
The Wave Mouse is an assistive technology device designed to empower individuals without hands by enabling them to interact with computers using hand wave gestures. This innovative mouse alternative uses motion sensors and microcontrollers to translate physical gestures into on-screen cursor movements and clicks, providing an accessible and dignified computing experience.

Key Features:

1. Gesture Detection:

Utilizes gyroscope sensors (MPU6050) to detect the tilt, orientation, and movement of the user's head or body.

Converts directional gestures (left, right, up, down) into cursor movements.



2. Microcontroller Integration:

Powered by a microcontroller ESP32, which processes sensor data and sends commands to the computer via USB or Bluetooth.

Lightweight firmware written in C/C++ interprets gestures in real-time.



6. Wearable Design:

Lightweight, wearable on the hand.

Comfortable for long-term use with minimal strain.




Technologies Used:

MPU6050 (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)

Arduino Nano (before)
ESP32 (Now for wireless connection)
